#For some kinds of story, I think we could have time limit. 
For example, if we have a story that is about a certain amount of time, 
we could have a timer that counts down, just like a story that you have to
find a certain item in a certain amount of time. If you run out of time, you lose.

#The timer is a simple counter that counts the choices you make.
and we can design the story that has multiple paths to win but we could grade it by the time you finish.

#This story is a simple example of a story which has a timer.

#Find the antidote before the timer runs out. When the timer runs out, you turn into a zombie.

#The shortest path is to go to the antidote before the timer runs out is 2 steps, but the 3 to 5 steps
should be OK but we lower the score. For over 5 steps, the score is 0, which means you lose and you die.

#You just bited by a zombie.
